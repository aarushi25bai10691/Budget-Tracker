# Project Statement: Personal Budget & Expense Tracker

## Problem Statement
Individuals, especially students and young professionals, often struggle to maintain financial discipline due to a lack of visibility into their daily spending habits. Without a centralized system to record and analyze transactions, it is difficult to track where money is going, leading to overspending and poor financial planning.

## Scope of the Project
The Personal Budget & Expense Tracker is a desktop/command-line application designed to help users record their daily financial transactions. The scope includes:
* User authentication to ensure data privacy.
* Recording income and expenses with specific categories (e.g., Food, Travel, Rent).
* Storing data persistently in a local database.
* Generating basic financial summaries (e.g., Total Income vs. Total Expense).

## Target Users
* **Students:** To manage monthly allowances and track discretionary spending.
* **Freelancers:** To separate irregular income and expense streams.
* **General Individuals:** Anyone seeking to improve their personal financial health.

## High-Level Features
1.  **User Management:** Secure registration and login functionality.
2.  **Transaction Management:** Ability to Add, View, Update, and Delete (CRUD) financial records.
3.  **Categorization:** Tagging transactions by type (Income/Expense) and Category.
4.  **Reporting:** A "Dashboard" view showing current balance and total spending by category.
